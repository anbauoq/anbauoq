# Heyy, I am Marina ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist specializing in NLP, large language models, and model reliability.  
I hold a BSc in Data Science from the American University of Armenia and currently work as a Data Science Intern at **ServiceTitan**, where I research hallucinations in LLM-powered voice assistants.


## ðŸ”¬ Interests & Technical Focus

I'm especially interested in making language models more accurate, interpretable, and robust. Topics I care about include:

- **LLM Reasoning**: step-by-step thinking, scratchpad methods, analogical reasoning  
- **Inference-time Optimization**: meta-generation, parallel decoding, self-correction  
- **Post-Training Techniques**: SFT, RLHF, DPO, GRPO, curriculum learning  
- **Robustness & Security**: jailbreak detection, adversarial attacks, red teaming  
- **Evaluation Without Supervision**: verifier-based scoring, uncertainty modeling  
- **Long-context & Agents**: retrieval-augmented generation, tool use, structured memory


## ðŸ“Œ Goals

Iâ€™m working toward building **LLMs that reason better, fail more transparently, and know when not to answer**.  
My long-term goal is to publish at **ICML**, contributing to safe and interpretable AI systems.
